#Here in the csv file firt I accepted the first name and last name from the uer and mergedd them to create a full name .

#After that I accepted marks ,height and weight and created report card to thow their graddes and calculate their BMI(Body Mass).

#  "Student.java" file implements basic calculation methods over marks of the students and the "height - Weight"

#Student-list.java file has been used for retriving the data from the csv file and formatting over it and storing it into a text file.

#Driver file is the dirver file which will be used to call all the methods implemented in all the classes.
